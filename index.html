## Module Overview

This e-Portfolio collects my key activities, discussions and reflections for the **Intelligent Agents** module (Oct 2025 cohort). It includes:

* Three **collaborative discussions**:
  * Agent-Based Systems (Units 1–3)
  * Agent Communication Languages (Units 5–7)
  * Deep Learning (Units 9–11)
* **Seminar preparation tasks** (Units 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12)
* **Design activities**, such as creating agent dialogues and parse trees
* A short **Deep Learning in Action** activity (Unit 10)
* A final **1,000-word reflection** on my learning and my role in the group project

The e-Portfolio is worth **40%** of the overall module mark, with a total word limit of **2,500 words** (1,500 words across activities + 1,000 words reflection). Screenshots of my posts, designs and code do **not** count towards this word limit.

## How this connects to the final e-Portfolio

As I progress through the module, this site will show:

* My **individual contributions** (posts, activities, designs)
* Evidence of **collaboration** in group work (especially Unit 6)
* Reflections on **what I learned**, **how I felt** and **what I will change next time**, using the *What? – So What? – Now What?* structure from Rolfe et al. (2001)

The final 1,000-word reflection will bring together the most important insights from these pages and relate them to the module **learning outcomes** on agent-based computing, agent models, intelligent systems and contemporary research issues.
