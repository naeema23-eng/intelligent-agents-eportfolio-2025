            <h4>Chosen application</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Deep learning for medical imaging diagnosis</strong> (e.g., detecting breast cancer and other conditions from radiology images).
            </p>

            <h4>Overview (what it does)</h4>
            <p>
              Deep learning models can support clinicians by analysing medical images (such as mammograms, CT, or MRI) to identify patterns
              associated with disease. These systems aim to improve sensitivity for early detection, reduce missed findings, and prioritise cases
              for review, especially in high-volume clinical settings.
            </p>

            <h4>How it works (brief synopsis)</h4>
            <p>
              Most diagnostic imaging systems use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or related architectures trained on labelled image datasets.
              During training, the model learns features that correlate with outcomes (e.g., malignant vs benign). At deployment, the model produces
              probability scores and may provide localisation cues (e.g., heatmaps) to support interpretation and auditing.
            </p>

            <h4>Potential socio-technical impacts</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ethics &amp; fairness:</strong> performance can vary across demographic groups if datasets are unbalanced, potentially amplifying health inequalities.</li>
              <li><strong>Privacy &amp; security:</strong> sensitive health data requires strict governance; model training and storage must respect consent and data minimisation.</li>
              <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> errors raise questions about responsibility (developer, hospital, clinician); governance must define oversight and escalation routes.</li>
              <li><strong>Social good:</strong> when validated properly, systems may support earlier detection and more consistent screening, improving outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I completed the “Creating Parse Trees” activity by constructing parse trees for sentences and identifying how grammatical
              structure (e.g., noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase) supports interpretation in NLP pipelines. This reinforced
              how language can be represented formally before higher-level reasoning or learning components are applied.
            </p>

            <h4>Example artefact (illustrative parse)</h4>
            <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> “The agent analysed the evidence in the archive.”</p>

            <pre><code>(S
  (NP (DT The) (NN agent))
  (VP (VBD analysed)
      (NP (DT the) (NN evidence))
      (PP (IN in)
          (NP (DT the) (NN archive))))
  (. .))</code></pre>

                Seminars strengthened my ability to connect theoretical models to applied design decisions, and reinforced the importance of
                governance, accountability, and responsible deployment in real systems.
