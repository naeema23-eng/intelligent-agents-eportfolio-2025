# Intelligent Agents – e-Portfolio

**Author:** Naeema Abdalla Ahmed Alnaqbi  
**Programme:** MSc Artificial Intelligence  
**Module:** Intelligent Agents  
**Assessment:** Individual e-Portfolio (40%)

## 1. Overview

This e-Portfolio presents a complete, structured, and evidence-based record of my learning and assessment work for the **Intelligent Agents** module.

The portfolio demonstrates my engagement with:

- Intelligent and multi-agent system foundations  
- Agent architectures (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, BDI)  
- Agent coordination and communication  
- Agent Communication Languages (KQML, FIPA-ACL)  
- Ethical, legal, and professional considerations in autonomous systems  
- Evaluation and reflection on intelligent agent technologies  

All required unit activities (Units 1–12) are represented through written artefacts, collaborative discussions, applied activities, and reflective analysis. Content is organised across interlinked HTML pages to support clarity, navigation, and academic assessment.

## 2. How to View the Portfolio

This portfolio is delivered as a set of static HTML pages.

### To view locally:

1. Extract the submitted folder (if zipped).  
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.  
3. Use the navigation menu to move between sections:
   - Discussions  
   - Activities  
   - Statistics  
   - Reflections  
   - About

## 3. Canonical (Primary) Assessment Pages

The following pages constitute the **primary assessment evidence** and are sufficient to evaluate all module learning outcomes:

| File | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| `index.html` | Entry point, orientation, and module overview |
| `discussion.html` | Collaborative Discussions 1–3 (initial posts, peer responses, summaries) |
| `activities.html` | Unit-based activities, applied tasks, and practical artefacts (Units 1–12) |
| `statistics.html` | Evaluation and comparative analysis of intelligent agent concepts |
| `reflections.html` | Final reflective account structured using Rolfe et al.’s model |
| `about.html` | Student background and submission context |

 These pages are directly accessible via the main navigation and represent the **core submission**.

  Agent Communication Languages: initial post, peer responses, and summary post.

- **Collaborative Discussion 3 (Units 9–11)**  
  Ethical implications of deep learning and intelligent agents: initial post, peer responses, and summary post.

### 4.2 Activities and Applied Work

- Agent architectures and reasoning models  
- Agent communication and coordination mechanisms  
- NLP and adaptive algorithms within intelligent agent systems  
- Ethical, legal, and professional considerations  
- Applied tasks and artefact documentation  

### 4.3 Reflection

## 5. Notes on Structure and Navigation

- Core assessment content is presented on canonical pages accessible via the main navigation.
- Content is organised to avoid duplication while maintaining clarity.
- All required artefacts and reflections are clearly labelled and contextualised.
- The portfolio structure mirrors the progression of the module units.

## 6. Academic Integrity

All work presented in this e-Portfolio is my own.

Academic sources and external materials are cited using **Harvard referencing**.  
No fabricated content is included. Reflections are based on genuine learning experiences and completed module activities.

AI tools were used **only** for grammar, language checking, and formatting support.

## 7. Verification

Supporting evidence is also available via:

- University of Essex Online VLE submissions  
- Module discussion forums  
- Tutor feedback records
