      <h2>About This e-Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        This e-Portfolio was developed as part of the <strong>Intelligent Agents</strong> module within the
        MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at the University of Essex Online. It presents evidence of my
        academic learning, analytical skills, and professional development across the duration of the module.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Naeema Alnaqbi</strong>. I am a biomedical engineer working within healthcare and
          pre-hospital operational environments, alongside postgraduate study in artificial intelligence.
          My professional interests lie at the intersection of intelligent systems, decision support,
          healthcare technology, and responsible AI deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through my academic work, I focus on how intelligent agents and autonomous systems can support
          complex, safety-critical environments while maintaining accountability, transparency, and ethical
          integrity.
