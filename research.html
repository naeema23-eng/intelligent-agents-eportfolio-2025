      <h2>Research Awareness &amp; Literature Engagement</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This page is <strong>not</strong> a full research proposal. It is a concise record of the key academic ideas and
        sources that informed my work across the Intelligent Agents module, including my discussions, practical
        activities, and project decisions.

      <h3>1. Key research themes explored</h3>

      <h4>1.1 What is an “agent” and how do we classify agents?</h4>
      <p>
        A recurring theme throughout the module is the definition of an intelligent agent and the properties that
        distinguish simple reactive systems from deliberative, learning, and social agents. I used the agent typologies
        and core concepts (e.g., rationality, autonomy, reactivity, proactiveness, social ability) to frame both theory
        and implementation choices (Russell and Norvig, 2021; Wooldridge, 2009).
      </p>

      <h4>1.2 Coordination and interaction in multi-agent systems (MAS)</h4>
      <p>
        My engagement with MAS focused on how independent agents cooperate or compete under limited information and
        distributed control. This includes communication protocols, organisational structures, and coordination
        mechanisms such as negotiation and task allocation (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999). I also reflected on how
        different coordination designs impact robustness, scalability, and failure modes in realistic systems.
      </p>

      <h4>1.3 Architectures and practical development frameworks</h4>
      <p>
        Translating theory into practice requires tools and methodologies. I examined the trade-offs between conceptual
        agent models and implementation frameworks, particularly when building structured agent systems (e.g., JADE and
        FIPA-aligned messaging). This helped me justify design decisions and better understand how “agent concepts”
        appear in real code (Bellifemine, Caire and Greenwood, 2007; Wooldridge, 2009).
      </p>

      <h4>1.4 Evaluation, limitations, and ethics</h4>
      <p>
        Evaluation in agent-based work is not only about performance; it also involves recognising system limitations
        and potential harm. I considered how assumptions (data quality, incentives, environment stability) affect agent
        outcomes and how ethical issues can emerge through bias, manipulation, or unsafe automation (Floridi et al.,
        2018; Russell and Norvig, 2021). This influenced how I discussed responsible development and the need for
        transparency and governance in agent systems.

      <h3>2. Selected literature highlights and why they mattered</h3>
      <ol class="refs-notes">
        <li>
          <strong>Wooldridge (2009)</strong> — Provided a clear foundation for agent definitions, MAS concepts, and formal
          reasoning. I used this as a “core anchor” when aligning my terminology and structuring explanations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Russell and Norvig (2021)</strong> — Supported broader AI framing (rational agents, environments, and
          decision-making) and helped connect agent ideas to wider AI concepts such as uncertainty and learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Jennings (2000)</strong> — Strengthened my understanding of why agent-oriented approaches are useful
          for complex systems and how autonomy + interaction shape system behaviour and engineering practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ferber (1999)</strong> — Helped clarify coordination challenges in MAS (distributed control, interaction,
          and emergent behaviour), which informed how I described multi-agent dynamics in my written work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bellifemine, Caire and Greenwood (2007)</strong> — Offered practical development insight (JADE),
          including architectural patterns and messaging concepts aligned with agent communication standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shoham and Leyton-Brown (2009)</strong> — Supported more formal thinking about multi-agent interaction,
          incentives, and game-theoretic perspectives. This was useful for discussing strategic behaviour and
          coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nwana (1996)</strong> — Provided an accessible taxonomy of agent types and applications, which helped
          justify and compare architectures in a structured way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Floridi et al. (2018)</strong> — Offered a strong ethics/governance lens for AI systems (including agent
          systems), reinforcing the importance of accountability, transparency, and human oversight.
        </li>

      <h3>3. How research informed my work in this module</h3>

      <h4>3.1 Discussions</h4>
      <p>
        The literature helped me move beyond descriptive discussion posts into more analytical arguments. For example,
        agent rationality and environment assumptions were used to structure points about behaviour and performance
        (Russell and Norvig, 2021), while MAS coordination literature supported my reasoning about collaboration and
        emergent effects (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999).
      </p>

      <h4>3.2 Activities and practical tasks</h4>
      <p>
        When working on practical tasks, I used architectural ideas from agent-oriented software and development
        frameworks to interpret implementation choices. This improved my ability to justify designs using academic
        language rather than purely technical description (Wooldridge, 2009; Bellifemine, Caire and Greenwood, 2007).
      </p>

      <h4>3.3 Project design choices</h4>
      <p>
        My project decisions were influenced by three recurring research-driven questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Autonomy vs. control:</strong> What should the agent decide independently, and what must remain governed
          by rules or human oversight? (Wooldridge, 2009; Floridi et al., 2018)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coordination complexity:</strong> Is agent interaction necessary, and if so, what mechanisms reduce
          failure and improve scalability? (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluation realism:</strong> Are assumptions stated clearly, and do evaluation measures reflect the
          environment the agent is meant to operate in? (Russell and Norvig, 2021)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Forward-looking research interests</h3>
      <p>
        Building on this module, I am interested in applying agent-based ideas in healthcare and emergency response
        settings, where coordination, time pressure, and safety constraints are critical. Potential directions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Agent-assisted decision support</strong> under uncertainty (triage support, resource allocation),
          grounded in rational-agent principles (Russell and Norvig, 2021).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-agent coordination</strong> for distributed operational environments (e.g., logistics and
          dispatch), drawing on MAS coordination literature (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsible agent systems</strong> with governance and oversight, including transparency and human
          accountability (Floridi et al., 2018).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These interests align with my professional context and help define a clear pathway for future MSc project work.
