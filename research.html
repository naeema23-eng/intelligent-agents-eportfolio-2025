          This page is <strong>not</strong> a full research proposal. It documents the key academic ideas, theories, and
          literature that informed my discussions, practical activities, and design decisions throughout the
          Intelligent Agents module.

          <h2>1. Key research themes explored</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Defining intelligent agents</h3>
          <p>
            A core theme throughout the module was understanding what constitutes an intelligent agent and how agents
            differ from traditional software components. I drew on foundational definitions of autonomy, rationality,
            reactivity, proactiveness, and social ability to frame both theoretical discussion and implementation choices
            (Russell and Norvig, 2021; Wooldridge, 2009).
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Coordination and interaction in multi-agent systems</h3>
          <p>
            My engagement with multi-agent systems focused on how independent agents cooperate or compete under
            distributed control and limited information. Research on coordination mechanisms, negotiation, and task
            allocation helped me reason about robustness, scalability, and emergent behaviour in realistic systems
            (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999).
          </p>

          <h3>1.3 Architectures and development frameworks</h3>
          <p>
            Bridging theory and practice required understanding agent architectures and development frameworks. I
            examined how conceptual models such as BDI and hybrid architectures are realised in practice through
            platforms such as JADE and FIPA-aligned communication, informing my design justifications and system
            explanations (Bellifemine, Caire and Greenwood, 2007; Wooldridge, 2009).
          </p>

          <h3>1.4 Evaluation, limitations, and ethics</h3>
          <p>
            Evaluation was treated as more than performance measurement. I considered system assumptions, failure
            modes, and ethical implications including bias, manipulation, and unsafe automation. This research lens
            influenced my emphasis on governance, transparency, and accountability in agent-based systems
            (Floridi et al., 2018; Russell and Norvig, 2021).

            <li>
              <strong>Wooldridge (2009)</strong> — Core reference for agent definitions, architectures, and multi-agent
              reasoning. Used as a conceptual anchor across the module.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Russell and Norvig (2021)</strong> — Provided broader AI context, particularly rational agents,
              environments, and decision-making under uncertainty.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jennings (2000)</strong> — Supported arguments for agent-oriented approaches in complex,
              distributed systems.

          <h2>3. How research informed my module work</h2>

          <h3>3.1 Discussions</h3>
          <p>
            Academic literature enabled me to structure discussion posts analytically rather than descriptively.
            Concepts such as agent rationality, environment assumptions, and coordination mechanisms supported more
            critical engagement with peer contributions (Russell and Norvig, 2021; Jennings, 2000).
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 Activities and practical tasks</h3>
          <p>
            Research on agent architectures and development frameworks informed how I interpreted implementation
            choices during practical tasks, allowing me to justify designs using academic language rather than
            purely technical description (Wooldridge, 2009; Bellifemine et al., 2007).
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Project design decisions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Autonomy vs. control:</strong> balancing independent agent decision-making with governance and
              human oversight (Wooldridge, 2009; Floridi et al., 2018).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coordination complexity:</strong> selecting interaction mechanisms that scale while reducing
              failure risk (Jennings, 2000; Ferber, 1999).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evaluation realism:</strong> aligning metrics and assumptions with the intended operating
              environment (Russell and Norvig, 2021).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card prose">
          <h2>4. Forward-looking research interests</h2>
          <p>
            Building on this module, I am interested in applying agent-based approaches in healthcare and emergency
            response contexts, where coordination, uncertainty, and safety constraints are critical.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agent-assisted decision support</strong> under uncertainty and time pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-agent coordination</strong> for distributed operational environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsible agent systems</strong> with transparency, auditability, and human oversight.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These interests align closely with my professional context and provide a foundation for future MSc project work.
