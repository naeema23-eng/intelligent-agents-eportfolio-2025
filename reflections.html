        This reflective account evaluates my learning, contributions, and professional development throughout the
        Intelligent Agents module. The reflection follows the
        <strong>Rolfe et al. (2001)</strong> model: <em>What? – So What? – Now What?</em>

        <h3>What? — Learning context and activities</h3>

        <p>
          The Intelligent Agents module introduced the theoretical foundations, practical techniques, and ethical
          implications of agent-based and multi-agent systems. Across Units 1–12, I engaged with a range of learning
          activities including collaborative discussions, critical peer responses, structured reading, and applied
          reasoning tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Key topics included agent architectures (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, and BDI), coordination and
          communication in multi-agent systems, agent communication languages (KQML and FIPA-ACL), and the integration
          of learning-based and generative models into agentic systems. These themes were explored through three
          collaborative discussions, each requiring an initial post, peer responses, and a final summary post.
        </p>

        <p>
          In parallel, module activities required me to consider how intelligent agents operate under uncertainty,
          how their performance can be evaluated quantitatively, and how ethical risks such as bias, misinformation,
          and accountability emerge when agents are deployed at scale. Together, these tasks formed a coherent
          learning journey that combined theory, application, and reflection.

        <h3>So What? — Analysis, emotions, and critical learning</h3>

        <p>
          At the start of the module, I primarily viewed intelligent agents as technical artefacts designed to optimise
          performance in distributed systems. My initial focus was on architectures, coordination mechanisms, and
          efficiency gains. However, engagement with peer discussions and contemporary literature significantly
          reshaped this perspective.

        <p>
          Discussion 1 highlighted that agent-based systems are inherently <em>socio-technical</em>. While decentralised
          autonomy improves scalability and resilience, it also introduces risks such as emergent behaviour,
          misalignment with organisational goals, and difficulties in verification. Peer feedback challenged my
          initial optimism and prompted deeper consideration of governance, formal verification, and human oversight
          as essential design components rather than optional safeguards.
