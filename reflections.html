        <h3>What? — Context, activities, and my role</h3>

        <p>
          The Intelligent Agents module explored the theory, design, and evaluation of agent-based and multi-agent systems,
          integrating conceptual foundations with applied and collaborative learning. Across Units 1–12, I participated
          in three structured collaborative discussions, analytical peer responses, applied reasoning activities, and a
          development team project in Unit 6. Together, these components formed a coherent learning journey that combined
          technical understanding, academic debate, and reflective practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most substantial applied component was the Unit 6 Development Team Project, in which our group designed a
          multi-agent system (MAS) for digital forensic triage. The proposed system decomposed a forensic workflow into
          specialised agents responsible for file scanning, filtering, hashing, secure archiving, and controlled
          transmission. Design decisions were informed by forensic constraints such as chain of custody, evidential
          integrity, and auditability, and were conceptually aligned with agent-oriented principles including autonomy,
          modularity, and controlled interaction (Wooldridge, 2021).
        </p>

        <p>
          My formally agreed role within the team was Project Lead, as documented in the Team Contract. I was responsible
          for coordinating timelines, overseeing the system architecture, integrating individual contributions, and
          ensuring alignment with the assessment criteria. I also contributed directly to the architectural design
          narrative, the explanation of agent roles and workflow, and sections of the critical evaluation. In addition,
          I took responsibility for final integration, academic tone, and consistency of referencing across the report.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside the team project, I actively engaged in collaborative discussions throughout the module. These
          required producing literature-grounded initial posts, responding critically to peers, and synthesising learning
          in summary posts. Discussion themes included agent-based systems in organisations, agent communication languages,
          and ethical challenges associated with learning-enabled and generative intelligent systems.

        <h3>So What? — Critical analysis, emotions, and learning</h3>

        <p>
          At the beginning of the module, my understanding of intelligent agents was primarily technical. I viewed agents
          mainly as architectural components designed to improve scalability, decentralisation, and performance. While
          this perspective provided a solid foundation, engagement with peer discussion, academic literature, and
          especially the Unit 6 project revealed important limitations in this approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Unit 6 team project marked a turning point in my learning. Designing a MAS for digital forensics made clear
          that agent-based systems are socio-technical systems, operating within legal, ethical, and organisational
          constraints rather than purely computational environments. Forensic requirements such as evidential
          admissibility and traceability significantly shaped design choices. Although our submission demonstrated strong
          domain understanding and a coherent pipeline, the tutor feedback highlighted a key weakness: several design
          decisions were described rather than critically justified in relation to operational constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          This feedback was particularly instructive. It revealed a tendency in my own work to rely on broadly accepted
          best practices—such as modular pipelines, hashing, and agent separation—without always interrogating why a
          specific choice was optimal in a given context. This highlighted the distinction between competent explanation
          and postgraduate-level critical evaluation, where alternatives must be weighed explicitly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emotionally, leading the team was both demanding and formative. I experienced a strong sense of responsibility
          for integration quality and deadlines, particularly when managing different writing styles and technical
          emphases. While this pressure was challenging, it reinforced the importance of early risk identification, clear
          role definition, and disciplined communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          The collaborative discussions further reshaped my thinking. Discussion 1 challenged my optimism about agent
          autonomy by exposing risks of emergent behaviour under weak governance. Discussion 2 clarified the trade-offs
          involved in agent communication languages, while Discussion 3 reframed ethics from a compliance requirement into
          a core engineering responsibility (Floridi et al., 2018; Dignum, 2019).
        </p>

      <div class="card prose">
        <h3>Now What? — Changed actions, skills gained, and future application</h3>

        <p>
          As a result of this module, my approach to designing and evaluating intelligent agent systems has fundamentally
          changed. I now assess agent-based solutions across four integrated dimensions: technical feasibility, domain
          constraints, ethical risk, and governance readiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          In future projects, I will explicitly compare alternative architectures and justify design decisions against
          real operational constraints. This directly addresses the weaknesses identified in the Unit 6 feedback and
          represents a clear change in my analytical practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Acting as Project Lead strengthened my ability to coordinate collaborative work, manage academic quality, and
          integrate diverse contributions into a coherent artefact. Structured peer discussion improved my academic
          communication, confidence in critique, and ability to revise positions based on evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, this module clarified my long-term academic direction. I am particularly interested in intelligent
          systems that support human decision-making rather than replace it, and in agent-based approaches that balance
          autonomy with accountability (Russell and Norvig, 2021; Wooldridge, 2021).

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, the Intelligent Agents module provided a demanding and transformative learning experience. Through
          collaborative discussion, applied system design, and structured reflection, I developed a more mature
          understanding of intelligent agents as embedded, governable, and evaluable systems rather than isolated
          technical solutions.
